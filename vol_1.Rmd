## What is this? A website? A report? RStudio?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When we **Knit** an R Markdown (.rmd) it will generate a document that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
> Slack uses a type of Markdown. you can also find Markdown on GitHub and Reddit!

This an example: You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
